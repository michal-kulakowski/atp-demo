					<p>Recently Wannacry ransomware has taken much attention in the news. It has disrupted healthcare services in the UK, disabled ATM's, railway control systems and public display screens. Now similar havoc is spread by Petya.A leveraging similar mechanisms.</p>
					<p>How is that different from ransomware of yesterday? For the first time ever ransomware got delivered as advanced peristent threat, which means attacker silently penetrated the network using Double Pulsar backdoor leaked from NSA, and only delivered ransomware payload 2 weeks later. Moreover the original infection mechanism was propagaing without user intervention (worm style) making original infection paricularly quick. This is also the reason why, despite high profile of the attack, we still do not know original attack vector behind it.</p>
					<p>Note that the vulnerability used by attacker was not zero day. Despite OS vendor's efforts to release fix early, there always will be some systems which cannot be patched on time, either because it would break application, or because OS management was skipped in product design phase (IoT).</p>

					<p>Observe <i>Wannacry attack detected</i> incident appear. It should take around 40 seconds from when script is run.</p>
				</td>
				<td>
					<p>Let us simulate the situation where future unknown variant of Wannacry gets installed somewhere on the network. Ideally it gets stopped on the perimeter, but that is not always possible. According to Verizon's 2016 <cite>Data Breach Investigation</cite> paper:
						<ul>
							<li>99% malware is only seen for 58 seconds or less</li>
							<li>99,5% malware is unique to organization under attack</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>On our simulated network there is FortiSanbox and FortiGate installed stopping all known threats on the spot and running analysis on the unknown ones. Sandboxing time is counted in minutes which means infections can be contained quickly across all organization and attack vectors but they cannot be ruled out (if the first download channel is real time like web, skype, etc the infected file will get through).</p>

					<p>Select the right incident. Click <i>Edit Rule</i> button.</p>
				</td>
				<td>
					<p>As you san see incident is detected, let us have a look on the correlation logic behind and why does it take SIEM to find what has happened.</p>
					<p>The rule looks for two triggers happening in sequence, within 300 seconds time window AND relating to the same source IP address. The security devices firing those triggers may and typically will be distinct. Big chunk of SIEM value is normalizing events coming form different sources so that they can be compared and observed together.</p>
					<p>In our demo scenario the first trigger was fired by logs from FortiSandbox which, upon analysis, found one payload downloaded over the web by one of the hosts to be high risk.</p>
					<p>The second one detects SMB traffic from host flowing to larger than usual numer of distinct destinations.</p>

					<p>First event is any event of class <i>Malware:Virus Found</i>. Note this may come from any fabric element: AV engine, FortiClient or Sandbox. In this case it is the latter which we care for most because, due to sandboxing technology specifics, this event may be known only after the file has been downloaded to the host. Regardless of the source IP of the host under attack is extracted for further analysis.</p>

				<td>
					<p>Here built in functions are used to count distinct destinations and compare them against static threshold. Alternative to this approach is comparing against straffic baseline which we are going to see next. This type of rule is still useful to detect incidents against new hosts on the network which do not have baseline yet.</p>

				<td>
					<p>In this formula we compare against traffic baseline collected weekly for every source IP to determine of current number of distinct SMB target addresses exceeds hourly average number of distinct flow targets by 3 standard deviations or more. In statistical language this means significant change in behaviour vs baseline.</p>
					<p>If the baseline is not defined, as it is the case in our lab the rule would cause division by zero and would fail silently without generating an incident. </p>

				<td>
					<p>Note while FortiSIEM never had any dicrect exposure to the victim, it got added to CMDB to <i>Malware Likely</i> category. FortiSIEM can reason about infrastructure based on multiple sources including logs, its own discovery and correlation of those. For example seeing events from Firewall, switch, DHCP server and Active Directory it can understand which domain user was logged onto offending workstation at the time of event and which switch port should be shut down in order to quarantine it.</p>

					<p>Click on <i>Network Device</i> branch, pick <i>FGT300D</i>, select <i>Health</i> tab.</p>
				</td>
				<td>
					<p>Upon discovering known device type, FortiSIEM can automatically poll performance and configuration data which is made available as events and usable in rules,reports and real time queries.</p>
					<p>Built in CMDB and discovery is great advantage since it minimizes external dependencies of the system, and helps SOC operator to see actual image of infrastructure and applications out there. This can significantly limit amount of hands on deck required for successful investigation saving labour, decreasing risk and speeding up reactions.</p>

					<p>What you have just seen is a system which can:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Help contain APT attacks by normalizing and correlating data from different sources. No matter how effective network policy enforcement is, it may eventually fail. Once breach happens average time to detect it is 205 days (Gartner 2016). Shortening that time is critical to limit damage and repeal attackers.</li>
						<li>Further reduce labour spent, reduce risk and cut analysis time by utilizing built in CMDB which is always up to date thanks to built in doscovery</li>
						<li>Streamline SecOps processes by integrating with organization's Incident Management system</li>
